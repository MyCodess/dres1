    Parametrizing Fixtures:
    pytest will then call the fixture once each for every set of values we provide.
    Then downstream (compared with Parametrizing Functions): every test function that depends on the fixture will be called, once each for every fixture value.
    Fixture parametrization has the benefit of having a fixture run for each setof arguments. This is useful if you have setup or teardown code that needsto run for each test caseâ€”maybe a different database connection, or differentcontents of a file, or whatever.
