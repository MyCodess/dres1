- see the final/best solution based on own-Logger-subclassing in ./customLevel_configfile_logging1_logClass/  !
- here NOT the best solution, but works!
- ! changing/setting logging-level in config-file affects the tracing if you set it for the root-logger under [logger_root] level= ... ! BUT not for the handlerss!
	so therefore not a complete solution! but works...!
- so to set the level to TRACE , you have to do it for the root-logger in log.conf ! not for its handler!!

- usage eg in:   python -m  use1_logconf
